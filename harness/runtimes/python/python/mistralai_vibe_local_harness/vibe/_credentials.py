"""SDK-independent contracts for Unified Harness provider credentials.

The Harness never resolves a provider credential itself: reading an OS keyring,
a ``.env`` file, or Google's application-default chain is host product state,
and interpreting a provider's key environment variable or API style is host
configuration. The Host implements this port and hands back resolved material;
the Harness only asks for it at the point of a model call and reports back when
a provider refused it.

Shaped after ``MCPAuthorizationProvider`` in ``_mcp_models``: a ``resolve`` that
returns either a snapshot or an "authorization required" state, and a ``reject``
that carries the revision the caller actually used so a concurrent refresh is
not discarded by a stale report.

"""Resolves the active provider's credential for a live Unified session.

The Harness is forbidden to read a keyring, a ``.env`` file, or a
``ProviderConfig``, so it holds a port and Vibe holds this service. Resolution
happens at the point of a model call rather than at session open, because a
credential that can expire mid-session cannot be a value frozen into a
derivation: a Google ADC token outlives its session by roughly an hour, and a
re-exported environment variable or a ``/config`` provider switch has no
derivation to ride in on.

Credential *schemes* are a behavioural reference to the legacy backends and are
kept in step with them by the authentication contract test, not by comment.

## [2.26.0] - 2026-10-05

### Added

- The app-server can discover built-in plugins from roots an embedding application ships, alongside the ones inside the package.
- Vibe Code warns when the selected model cannot view attached images.
- Vibe Code sessions list their background processes in a side panel with live status indicators and a Stop action for running ones.
- The `~/.vibe/.env` fallback for the API key when the OS keyring is unavailable is now created owner-only (0600), so a saved key is no longer readable by other accounts on the machine.
- Rust CLI: first-run onboarding wizard with theme selection, API key entry stored in the OS keyring, and browser sign-in; it opens automatically when the API key is missing, and `--setup` runs it and exits.
- Rust CLI: `/teleport`, `&<prompt>` and `--teleport` send the session to Vibe Code Web, with push approval and Esc to cancel.
- Rust CLI: Configure voice mode and narration with `/voice`.
- Rust CLI: Schedule recurring prompts in natural language with `/loop` and model-managed cron tools.
- Rust CLI: Undo and redo composer edits with platform-aware keyboard shortcuts.
- Rust CLI: `vibe update` and `--check-upgrade` ask the install's own package manager (uv, Homebrew, or PyPI) what it can deliver and prompt to upgrade the CLI.
- Rust CLI: update checks honor `enable_system_trust_store` — bundled Mozilla roots by default, the OS trust store when enabled.
- Rust CLI: Clicking the scrollbar track scrolls one page; holding it keeps scrolling until the thumb reaches the pointer.
- Rust CLI: Client usage telemetry now reaches the analytics pipeline: startup timings, slash commands, @-mentions, copies, cancellations and voice transcription events, with the detected terminal reported at launch.
- Models accept a `thinking_levels` field to offer only the thinking levels they support.
- Rust CLI: `/mcp` shows connector display names, plugin owners, and a link to add connectors in Studio.
- `/mcp <name>` also accepts the display name shown in the browser, and unknown names list those display names.
- Per-model `max_context_length` setting, editable in `/config`.
- Rust CLI: Mention skills anywhere in a prompt with `/skill-name`, with the same caret-based completion popup as `@` file mentions.
- Rust CLI: Accepted `/skill` and `@file` completions and pasted images are highlighted in the prompt and edited as a single unit.
- Rust CLI: Long pastes show as a `[Pasted n characters]` placeholder, also once sent or rewound; paste the same text again right away to show it in full.
- Rust CLI: Scrolling to the top of a resumed session or a `/resume` preview loads its older messages automatically.
- Rust CLI: the startup banner hint now explains that unsetting `VIBE_CLI` (or setting it to `python`) switches to the legacy Python TUI.
- Documented the `VIBE_CLI` selector, including the Windows session-variable forms, for running the legacy Python TUI.
- Publish a source distribution on PyPI again, so Homebrew can build new releases.
- Rust CLI: Typing a command followed by a space shows its arguments inline (e.g. `/loop`, `/mcp`, `/rename`) until the first argument is typed.
- Fork an earlier completed response while a session continues generating.
- A plugin can bundle its own MCP server executable and launch it with a `./` command in its `mcp.json`.
- Project-links and teleport support in the VS Code extension: link a local workspace to a Vibe Code Web project and teleport the current conversation to continue it in the browser.
- While the model provider is unavailable, Vibe shows which retry it is on and counts down to the next attempt.
- `/status` shows the active model, provider, and API base.
- You can now choose the model behind session titles and smart approve with `[utility_models]` in your config; `active` pins a feature to the model your session runs.
- The worktree step of a new session shows what it is doing while it is created, including how many files have been checked out.
- Xcode setup instructions for using Mistral Vibe as an ACP agent.

### Changed

- `workspace/git/worktrees/remove` gained additive `inspect`, `force`, and `deleteBranch` params plus `branchCreated`/`holders` response fields, so a client can probe a removal before committing to it.
- A session that starts in a worktree now announces the prepared worktree over `session/updated` before the session moves, so clients that gate their UI on it can proceed as soon as it exists.
- Unified backend: a tool set to `permission = "never"` now denies a sensitive path instead of prompting for it.
- Packaged `vibe`, `vibe-acp`, and `vibe-app-server` executables now always ship the Unified Runtime; a build that cannot collect it fails instead of producing a legacy-only binary.
- Vibe now always runs on the Unified Harness by default and exits with an actionable error when the runtime is missing or broken, instead of silently falling back to the legacy engine.
- Rust CLI: Pasted images show as numbered `[Image #N]` placeholders instead of their file path.
- Rust CLI: Several images attached to one message are listed as a tree.
- Rust CLI: Web search queries and source titles are sanitized, and long source titles wrap aligned under their bullet.
- hooks.toml hooks on the unified harness receive session_id, transcript_path and parent_session_id on stdin again, matching the legacy runtime.
- Builtin tool_input reaches hooks with the CLI's author-facing argument names, and a pre_tool rewrite of those names takes effect.
- A hook's system_message shows as the hook's result line, and a hook that fails to run reports the real reason instead of a generic message.
- Rust CLI: The `/resume` picker takes at most 40% of the screen height.
- Previewing a saved session in the resume picker is much faster.
- Rust CLI: The command and skill completion menu closes as soon as anything is typed after the command.
- Rust CLI: Tab-completing a command or skill adds a trailing space, ready for its arguments.
- A compaction model on a different provider than the active model is now ignored with a warning instead of rejecting the configuration.
- CLI session titles now describe the whole task, stop changing after a single confirmation pass, and survive resume unchanged
- Session titles now draw on tool results (fetched PRs, changed files) so terse prompts still get a useful title
- Session titles are now generated by default for CLI (opt out with `session_logging.generate_titles = false`) and run on the session's own model and provider.
- Session titles and smart approve now check once whether your deployment serves a small fast model, instead of assuming it from the endpoint's address.
- Custom and self-hosted Mistral deployments that serve a small model now get fast session titles and a fast smart-approve classifier, rather than falling back to your coding model.
- Where your deployment serves no small model, session titles and smart approve run on your session's model, which costs more per call; name a cheaper one under `[utility_models]`.
- New session worktrees check their files out in parallel, roughly halving creation time in large repositories.

### Fixed

- Forked Unified Harness sessions now keep their original cache affinity to improve prompt cache reuse.
- Forked Unified Harness sessions running in managed worktrees now use independent managed worktrees.
- Forking a live Unified Harness session preserves its active configuration.
- Isolated forks no longer inherit or revoke the caller's --trust grant.
- Worktree sessions now use one configuration update for the displayed, executed, and model-visible working directory.
- Managed-worktree forks warn when uncommitted source changes remain outside the fork.
- Smart Approve no longer asks for approval on every command or edit that names a file in a managed worktree under `~/.vibe/worktrees`.
- Smart approve no longer sends every classification to a model name your deployment may not serve, which made it ask for approval on every call.
- Closing one session no longer stops other sessions sharing the same harness.
- Plugins cannot claim the reserved `subagent` or `skill` namespaces.
- Auto-update only reports success once the new version is installed, and offers a forced reinstall when a pinned uv install stays on the old version.
- Teleport no longer fails with "Failed to summarize context" on the experimental harness when the model uses thinking.
- Rust CLI: Show microphone-access guidance when voice recordings capture no audio.
- Rust CLI: Dictated text is inserted at the caret, and the caret follows it.
- Rust CLI: Markdown horizontal rules, strikethrough, task lists, images, and hard line breaks now render with Textual parity.
- Rust CLI: Enable clipboard copying over SSH on Windows.
- Rust CLI: Keep keyboard input working after an empty piped prompt.
- Rust CLI: Clean up Windows app-server child processes on exit.
- Rust CLI: Avoid unsupported suspension hints on Windows.
- Rust CLI: `/clear` shows the previous session id and how to resume it.
- Rust CLI: tool calls separated only by an answered approval or a background notice now stay in the same folded block instead of opening a new one.
- Rust CLI: Expanding a tool result or group scrolls it into view, and expanding or collapsing keeps the clicked header in place.
- Rust CLI: Ctrl+O keeps the view on the same content instead of jumping to earlier messages.
- Telemetry now labels background calls (session titles, worktree names, smart-approve checks) with their own call type, so they no longer count as regular model calls.
- Unified harness turns report legacy turn error codes again (rate-limited, incomplete-stream, refused-key), so auto-retry and the `/retry` hint work; request telemetry carries attachment counts again.
- A background start asks before running, honors the shell's allowlist and denylist, and remembers your approval for later starts; a start that sets its own environment or working directory always asks.
- Reading a background process's output or the process list no longer prompts, writing to one asks for that process only in the current session, and stopping one never prompts.
- Unified backend: a file tool set to `permission = "never"` with an `allowlist` now writes where the allowlist permits, instead of refusing everything
- Unified backend: the `plan` agent can write its plan file again
- Rust CLI: The interactive question free-text input now shares the composer keybindings (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+E, Ctrl+U, Ctrl+K, word navigation, Home/End, Delete).
- Rust CLI: Ctrl+D respects `ask_confirmation_on_exit`, and the quit hint names the pressed key and warns about queued messages.
- Rust CLI: Saving an edit to a queued prompt now leaves queue selection mode, so Enter steers the running turn instead of reopening the editor.
- Rust CLI: Inline code inside a Markdown link label now opens the link when clicked.
- Rust CLI: Hovering a wrapped link highlights every row of it.
- Restored the subagents list and transcripts after resuming a session.
- Rust CLI: Pasted tabs and zero-width characters no longer leave undeletable ghost characters in the chat input.
- Rust CLI: Tabs in submitted prompts now show in the transcript instead of disappearing.
- Rust CLI: Scripts like Khmer no longer shift the rest of the row or break the scrollbar.
- Rust CLI: Wrapped lines of a user message now align with the start of its text instead of the prompt marker.
- Rewind in the Rust CLI now offers to restore files changed since the chosen message, and restores them.
- Rust CLI: Refreshing `/mcp` also reloads workspace connectors and no longer piles up requests or floods the transcript with errors.
- Refreshing `/mcp` still re-discovers MCP servers when workspace connectors fail to load.
- Rust CLI: Rejected `/mcp` toggles roll back only their own row with a warning, enabling no longer shows a status early, and plugin servers cannot be toggled.
- Rust CLI: `/mcp <name>` on a server that needs auth opens its login instead of an empty panel.
- Rust CLI: A viewed `/mcp` source that starts needing auth opens its login instead of an empty panel.
- Rust CLI: After an MCP login, the login panel shows `Connecting...` until `/mcp` reopens instead of going blank.
- `/mcp` no longer offers `Connect` on a source whose bootstrap failed.
- `/mcp` reports when connectors fail to load instead of saying nothing is configured.
- Rust CLI: Multi-line `/mcp` errors keep their line breaks instead of running together.
- Refreshing a connector after signing in no longer resets token stats and skill completions.
- Toggling a connector in `/mcp` no longer fails once the connector cache is over ten minutes old.
- `/mcp` shows tools disabled by the global `disabled_tools`/`enabled_tools` patterns as disabled.
- Plugin MCP servers show their session connection status and prompt for login when needed.
- Rust CLI: Starting a background process no longer flashes the full command in the loading spinner.
- Rust CLI: Pasting an image path into a `!` shell command keeps the raw path.
- Rust CLI: Resumed sessions show each attached image under the name its prompt gave it, and clicking it opens the image.
- Rust CLI: Scrolling no longer lags when an expanded tool group holds large tool outputs.
- Manual `!` shell commands stay in the transcript after an app-server restart or session resume on the experimental harness.
- Resuming a session imported from an older Vibe version no longer fails when its transcript carries embedded resource blocks.
- Rust CLI: Esc closes the open todo panel instead of rejecting a pending tool approval or question.
- Rust CLI: Web search and URL fetch results from the Unified harness render as readable sources and page text instead of raw JSON.
- Rust CLI: Web fetch and web search results trim blank edges and only make http(s) sources clickable, matching the Python CLI.
- Resumed Unified Harness sessions report older history, so clients can page past the latest 200 messages.
- Rust CLI: A malformed older-history reply warns about the failed load instead of silently ending paging.
- Update checks for uv tool installs now respect uv settings such as `exclude-newer`.
- Building Vibe from source without Rust now fails early with install instructions
- Wheel builds missing the bundled Harness Python runtime or Rust CLI now fail loudly instead of shipping a broken package.
- Rust CLI: Ctrl+C interrupts a running turn or teleport whenever the loading hint offers it.
- Rust CLI: The loading hint offers Ctrl+C to cancel a queued message whenever that is what Ctrl+C does.
- Rust CLI: Interrupting a prompt before the server starts its turn now interrupts that turn once it starts.
- Rust CLI: Ctrl+C rejects a pending tool approval or cancels an open question, as Esc does.
- Rust CLI: Ctrl+C exits on the first press after the app server crashes, as its notice says.
- Rust CLI: Pasting or dropping several files from Finder inserts one image placeholder or `@` mention per file.
- Rust CLI: Ctrl+V and `/paste-image` insert the images copied in Finder instead of their icon.
- Rust CLI: Image pastes are accepted when the backend can describe images for a text-only model.
- Rust CLI: A message holding the same image file twice is sent instead of failing to enqueue.
- Rust CLI: Pasted clipboard images are saved as `vibe-pasted-images/clipboard-<timestamp>.png`, like the Python CLI.
- Rust CLI: A rejected prompt shows the server's reason, not only the failing request.
- Failed connector tool calls now show the underlying cause (e.g. gateway HTTP 404, SSL error) instead of an opaque TaskGroup error.
- Rust CLI: Clicking a tool call group header no longer flashes a text selection before toggling.
- Opening a session over ACP now reports the app-server's field-level error detail (e.g. which transcript field failed validation) instead of the bare 'Invalid request parameters' protocol code name.
- Resuming a session no longer fails when its model is on a different provider than the configured compaction model.
- A session created by a newer Vibe resumes on an older one instead of failing to validate, and keeps the settings that older build cannot read.
- Overwriting a file shows what changed, instead of reading as a newly created file.
- Resuming a session whose transcript holds an @-mention no longer fails on embedded resources stored without a kind tag.
- Preserve pending permission prompts and running status when reconnecting to a chat.
- Teleport now resolves git at the session's workspace instead of the agent process's cwd, fixing 'requires a git repository' errors on eligible projects.
- Rust CLI: Edit and write tool results start collapsed and expand or collapse on click.
- Rust CLI: Expanded edit results show their diff again.
- Turns no longer crash with "Completed public history entry is frozen" when a backend reuses tool call ids.
- A new worktree session accepts its first message right away instead of after the worktree is created.

## [2.25.8] - 2026-09-23

### Added

- Rust CLI: support for configuring Vibe Code remote projects
- Clean up managed worktrees after archiving local sessions
- Archive local sessions so they can be hidden from active session lists
- Vibe Desktop now shows unseen indicators for local Code sessions that need attention or finish a turn
- Rust CLI: the live todo plan pins above the input, and Cmd+\ opens the full plan in a right sidebar.

### Fixed

- MCP servers declared by a plugin now start, so the tools they carry are callable in the session
- Rust CLI: Support sessionless MCP server add and remove commands from the shell.
- Rust CLI: File completions respect the caret, preserve surrounding text, and allow directory descent.
- Rust CLI: Filter MCP servers and connectors with / in the MCP browser.
- Text selection, copying, and scrolling in trusted-folder prompts.
- Rust CLI no longer renders raw ANSI escape codes from tool output as garbled text.
- Rust CLI: Pasting into an interactive question now lands in the free-text answer box instead of the composer.
- Rust CLI: Selecting transcript text while an interactive question is open now highlights and copies it.
- Rust CLI: The question text, its options and the waiting row are now selectable with the mouse while a question is open; the option prefix (cursor, numbering, checkbox) is never selected or copied.
- Rust CLI: Releasing a selection while a question is open now flashes the `Copied` inline notice, and only when autocopy is enabled.
- Rust CLI: Selecting text while a question without the free-text row (`hideOther`) is open now anchors from every box row instead of none.
- Rust CLI config editor now clearly identifies each setting's source and save layer
- Rust CLI config editor keeps the caret visible at exact-width line endings
- `/leanstall` and `/unleanstall` now work on the unified backend instead of failing
- `/leanstall` and `/unleanstall` no longer crash the TUI on the unified backend
- Uninstalling the agent the session is running switches it back to the default agent on the unified backend
- Rust CLI exits cleanly when its terminal disconnects.
- Rust CLI: toast text can be selected and copied without dismissing the toast
- Rust CLI: preserves transcript ordering when session snapshots arrive
- Rust CLI: the what's-new banner is dismissed by the first prompt instead of staying pinned at the bottom

- Reject enforced model policies that match no configured models
- Unified Harness: subagents defined in `~/.vibe/agents` or `.vibe/agents` can be spawned again
- Unified Harness: an agent that names its own `system_prompt_id` runs on that prompt instead of the default
- An agent file the harness cannot honor is reported instead of disappearing silently
- Switching to an agent before the first message now applies its prompt, not just its tools
- Relative path allowlists no longer authorize files just because the path ends with the same suffix.
- Shell command wildcards no longer skip outside-workdir path checks.
- Legacy parent-folder grants no longer cover nested descendants, so some outside-workdir accesses may ask for approval again.
- On macOS 26 and later, the native harness no longer fails to load with a 'mis-aligned LINKEDIT string pool' error.
- MCP OAuth login no longer fails after the browser callback on servers that issue a client secret (e.g. Supabase)
- Abandoned MCP OAuth logins now time out and release the loopback callback port instead of blocking later logins until exit
- Outside-workdir approvals now apply to the referenced file or, for a folder, its full tree.
- Scrolling the Rust CLI transcript no longer stutters on long sessions with large edit diffs or file bodies.
- The todo list now updates while the agent is running a `run_typescript` program, instead of staying frozen until the program finishes.
- Unified Harness: restore lazy injection of subdirectory AGENTS.md docs on read_file, matching the legacy harness

## [2.25.7] - 2026-09-22

### Fixed

- Allow /teleport with Vibe and workspace API keys, including free accounts, without an internal feature gate.
- Explain which API keys to use when teleport rejects a Codestral key.
- Warn when managed configuration contains removed Vibe Code settings.
- On Windows, opening a session that is already open in another process reports 'Session is already open' instead of a raw permission error.
- On Windows, idle-session cleanup no longer mistakes a session held by another process for an idle one.
- Automatic project context no longer runs repository-configured Git clean or process filters.

## [2.25.6] - 2026-09-21

### Added

- Attach images while running a model that cannot see them: under `--experimental-harness`, any vision-capable model on the active model's own provider describes them for the agent. Set `vision_model` in `config.toml` to override that choice or to use another provider.

### Changed

- Vibe packages now bundle the Unified Harness Runtime
- Described UI and design screenshots now include a layout contract — regions, colors, typography hierarchy, and recurring components — so the agent can rebuild them.
- VS Code narration now plays through the ACP subprocess (PortAudio) instead of the webview AudioContext, following the system default output device mid-playback

### Fixed

- Invalid MCP server tables now show actionable configuration guidance instead of a traceback
- Concurrent Vibe sessions now merge their prompt history instead of overwriting each other.
- Submitting a prompt no longer pauses the UI on history file I/O.
- The session no longer freezes for good when a burst of subagents finishes at the same time
- Path completion no longer inserts outdated suggestions while searching.
- ACP integrations now preserve Windows MCP executable paths containing spaces and backslashes
- Picking a model and a thinking level together no longer leaves that model's configuration unwritable when the model came from a rollout.
- A session reopens on the thinking level it ran with, instead of the level another session left in the configuration.
- Secure Git fetches no longer trust inherited Git configuration path overrides.
- Repository worktree configuration can no longer rewrite validated Git fetch URLs.
- Untrusted checkouts can no longer choose the SSH client or Git hooks used for approval-free fetches.
- Secure fetches reject encoded network file paths, checkout-controlled credential helpers, and repository HTTP configuration.
- Risky options, output operands, repository hooks, and shell redirections on otherwise read-only commands now require approval.
- Git-reader approvals are scoped to one repository and cover repeated commands and remerge diffs.
- Interactive pager input now requires approval on PowerShell and when session metadata cannot be verified.
- `/mcp login` fails loudly when a server never issues an OAuth challenge, instead of reporting a false success with no token
- Opening a session is faster on machines with many git worktrees: listing them no longer re-inspects each one, and the composer's model and approval-policy pickers no longer wait for the session to resume.

## [2.25.5] - 2026-09-18

### Added

- Subagent conversation history is readable through the owning parent session
- Configurable live subagent status and read-only transcript switching from the interactive prompt
- `--experimental-harness` sessions can track todos, shown as a pinned line under the input and in full on `/todo`, and keep a per-session scratchpad whose notes are re-stated to the agent after the conversation is summarised.
- Turn an installed skill on or off from the `/skills` browser without removing it.
- Skill authors can mark skills as explicit-only, keeping slash invocation available while preventing model-initiated loading.
- `vibe mcp add --allow-insecure-http` and `/mcp add --allow-insecure-http` opt into plaintext http:// MCP servers on non-localhost hosts, such as a server on the LAN.
- Tool telemetry events now carry approval_source (config/smart/user/bypass/never) to distinguish how a tool call was authorized.
- Press `r` in the MCP servers & connectors panel to refresh the list on demand.
- Connectors view now links to Studio to add more connectors, pre-scoped to your org and workspace.
- Local app-server sessions now persist and expose their latest accepted user interaction timestamp for downstream session resources.
- Unified Harness app-server sessions can now be pinned, and remember it across restarts.
- Scheduled loops (/loop) are now available in the Vibe VS Code extension with a panel UI for creating, listing, editing, and canceling recurring prompts.
- Vulnerability disclosure guidance and private reporting instructions in SECURITY.md.
- /teleport now works under --experimental-harness

### Changed

- The Unified Harness is no longer labeled "experimental"; `--legacy-harness` is the documented escape hatch back to the legacy Python harness.
- Sessions with OAuth MCP servers configured start faster: fewer and overlapping keychain reads.
- Approving a shell command with a variable expansion now covers the next call that differs only in the expansion.
- Switched the audio engine to miniaudio to improve stability and performance of voice recording and playback
- Connectors are listed and titled by their display name, falling back to the connector name.
- Removed the local Cargo build job cap that limited editable builds to 2 jobs, restoring full parallelism for local harness builds.
- Admin-managed config now enforces the individual keys it sets inside `session_logging`, `project_context` and `experiments`, rather than the whole group. Keys an admin does not set are taken from the user's own config instead of being reset to defaults.
- A model change requested while a turn is running is now accepted and applied at the next turn boundary, instead of being rejected.
- The Vibe CLI now sends a dedicated `MistralAI-VibeCLI/<version>` User-Agent header on MCP HTTP requests, letting the connectors gateway distinguish Vibe CLI tool calls from other MCP clients.

### Fixed

- Images attached to text-only models now fall back to file links instead of failing the turn.
- Worktree sessions now tell the agent about the worktree working directory instead of the original checkout.
- Subagents no longer prompt for tool permission when the parent session is in auto-approve mode under the Unified Harness
- Workspace trust decisions over ACP now require a session and can only target its working directory.
- The experimental unified harness can now record the IDE's workspace trust decision.
- Keep skills with invalid invocation policy metadata explicit-only instead of exposing them to the model.
- Creating or cleaning up a worktree no longer runs the repository's own git hooks (such as post-checkout) or its fsmonitor command.
- Show retrying status during transient provider failures.
- Cancelling a turn no longer hangs when the interrupt wedges server-side, and an interrupt that is taking unusually long now warns with the force-quit hint instead of leaving you staring at a silent "Interrupting" spinner.
- Message sending after resuming pre-existing sessions that use connectors
- Attaching an image from outside the workspace (e.g. ~/Downloads) in a fresh session no longer fails with 'Image file is outside the workspace or session attachments'.
- Existing session logs are restricted to owner-only permissions when Vibe starts.
- Vibe's home directory and the logs inside it are now accessible only to the current user.
- Tool telemetry events now carry the actual approval decision (execute/skip) and approval type (always/never/ask) instead of always None.
- MCP and connector tool calls now respect the permission system: they honor each tool's configured permission, ask before running by default, and remember your approval for later calls.
- The enabled_tools and disabled_tools config globs now apply to MCP tools, not just connector tools.
- `session_logging.enabled = false` is honoured again on the Unified Harness: the conversation and its attachments no longer land in the session save directory, the session log summary reports that logging is off, and `--continue`/`--resume` are refused with the same message the legacy backend gives.
- Hooks now run inside subagents on the experimental harness, instead of being silently skipped.
- `pre_tool` and `post_tool` hooks now run for the `skill` tool, which previously took no hooks at all.
- Hook commands using pipes, `&&`, redirects, globs or `$VAR` now run through the shell.
- A hook's `match` now matches the tool the model actually calls, including `edit` and MCP tools.
- Unified Harness now injects the current git branch, status, and recent commits into the system instructions, matching the legacy backend
- Shell approvals no longer widen to cover a different program, subcommand, custom shell, or environment.
- Shell approvals no longer cover side-effecting options that the command's guardrails gate.
- Approving a guardrailed command whose argument the shell could not read no longer approves the same command with a different one.
- A shell call that can only be approved as written -- a redirect, a heredoc, a command the shell could not read -- is no longer covered by a wider approval for the same program.
- A permanent approval a tool's allowlist cannot express is kept to the session instead of written there, and now says which scopes it kept.
- Saving a setting while another part of Vibe reads the same config file no longer fails the request
- Starting a turn after an enqueued first message no longer fails while a worktree is being prepared.
- Agent and experiment updates no longer conflict with a worktree setup turn the UI already shows as running.
- Stopping a worktree setup turn now runs the next queued message.
- A dropped first-turn response no longer blocks later turns while a worktree is being prepared.
- A dropped stop response no longer leaves a worktree setup turn stuck.
- Creating a loop via /loop no longer fails with an opaque "Internal error"; app-server errors are now surfaced with their actual message.
- `/mcp login` now recovers when a stored OAuth token refresh fails transiently (e.g. the server returns 5xx); it discards the stuck credentials and retries a fresh authorization instead of failing every retry.
- Shell commands using line continuations now require approval.
- `sort --files0-from` now requires approval before reading listed files.
- Teleport no longer runs repository-configured external diff or text conversion helpers when preparing diffs.
- Teleport no longer runs repository-configured file-monitor hooks when preparing diffs.
- WebFetch now requires separate approval before following redirects to another origin.
- Vibe no longer runs a project-local Git executable during automatic repository inspection.
- Config layers now merge key by key, so setting one nested value through an environment variable or a project file no longer discards the rest of that group.
- Reopening a session now restores the model that was picked last, not the one the last turn started with.
- Changing the model in the CLI no longer stops the session's live display.
- Smart approve now asks you to confirm a risky action you requested, instead of blocking it repeatedly and giving up.
- Commands that discard output, such as `ls 2>&1` or `make >/dev/null`, no longer ask for approval. Redirections that write to a file still do.
- Smart approve no longer asks you to confirm deleting a file the agent created earlier in the same session.
- Smart approve no longer prompts when a tool only reads `.vibe/` or `.git/` configuration; it still asks before writing one.
- Smart approve no longer overrides your permission rules: a command your rules had already gated is no longer auto-approved.
- Smart approve now reclassifies each risky call instead of reusing an earlier decision, so revising your instructions mid-session takes effect immediately.
- Keep a subagent's initial instruction visible after long transcripts
- Crash when the subagent list updates while a row is highlighted
- Escape now returns from a subagent transcript to the main conversation
- Quit confirmation no longer leaks after leaving a subagent transcript
- Clearing or resuming no longer races subagent transcript refreshes
- Resumed sessions and tool approvals no longer stall when notifications arrive
- Providers configured without an API key environment variable — local or self-hosted model servers — run again on the Unified Harness instead of failing every turn with a missing VIBE_API_KEY error.
- A provider error on the Unified Harness shows the provider's own explanation again, such as "model is overloaded" or "context length exceeded", instead of only the HTTP status line and the request URL.
- Queueing a message on a Unified session no longer risks killing the app server when the queue change arrives on a session state update.
- Opening a session and loading the session list are much faster on machines with many linked checkouts: reads no longer resolve plugins, MCP servers and connectors they never use, and Desktop asks for a project's sessions in one request instead of one per checkout.

## [2.25.4] - 2026-09-12

### Fixed

- Connector discovery excludes raw HTTP connectors that do not support MCP tools.
- A single invalid connector no longer prevents the rest of your connectors from loading; an individual tool with an oversized schema is dropped on its own, and accounts over the connector cap keep a bounded catalog instead of loading none.
- Automatic session titles use the active model on custom Mistral endpoints.
- Smart-approve now appears in the Vibe Desktop mode picker when enabled via its rollout, and a background refresh no longer drops it.
- ACP clients (Zed/JetBrains) always list the active mode, so a session can never get stuck on a mode missing from its own list.
- Smart-approve now escalates to a confirmation prompt when a risky action is requested again, instead of only blocking it, and shows the reason it is asking.
- Auto-approved calls no longer read as warnings: the reason smart-approve let a call run is shown as a note rather than a warning.
- `@` file mentions now resolve against every workspace root, including `--add-dir` ones.
- A `@` mention outside the workspace no longer rejects the whole message; it stays plain text and the read tool can still ask for it.
- `--add-dir` no longer drops the working directory from the file tools' workspace roots.
- Shell permission checks now require approval for risky syntax and command options that could bypass workspace and denylist controls (CVE-2026-87984, CVE-2026-87985, CVE-2026-87986, CVE-2026-87987, and residual CVE-2026-87988 variants).

## [2.25.3] - 2026-09-11

### Added

- New `/branch` command forks the current conversation into a new resumable session, leaving the current session unchanged. Resume the copy in another terminal with `vibe --resume <id>`.

### Changed

- Bump the local harness runtime to v0.4.5.
- Make @ file mentions use Git-aware discovery and accept standalone pasted files and folders.

### Fixed

- Retained chats remain readable and restore their worktrees when work resumes.
- New session logs are no longer readable by other users on POSIX systems.
- AGENTS.md instructions now load into the system prompt under the experimental unified harness.

## [2.25.2] - 2026-09-10

### Added

- VS Code extension: debug submenu with log level picker, open log file, and a togglable session status panel showing agent statistics (steps, tokens, tokens/sec, context, cost)

### Changed

- Open the session picker faster by building the merged session listing once per cursor walk instead of on every page.
- Renamed `SessionBackendKind` literals from `"python"`/`"rust"` to `"legacy"`/`"unified"` to match backend identity naming.

### Fixed

- An "always" permission grant that fails to reach `~/.vibe` now warns instead of passing silently: `ConfigOrchestrator.set_field` returns its errors rather than raising, so an ignored failure looked exactly like a successful write and the next session asked again with nothing to explain why.
- Steered prompts now preserve their host-provided display content in app-server session history.
- Preserve the selected permission mode when a session starts in a worktree.
- Managed worktree creation, attachment, and retention cleanup are serialized across processes, and stale reservations are recovered safely.
- Stop dropping a session from the picker when it is touched while paging through the list.

## [2.25.1] - 2026-09-09

### Added

- Desktop keeps 15 recent managed Code worktrees by default, configurable in Local Coding settings; cleanup skips active, dirty, untracked, or unpushed worktrees.
- Background process tools (process.start, process.stop, process.output, process.list, process.write) now show the command or process ID in the call header and a typed result widget instead of raw JSON.
- Tool call groups now fold into a single compact summary line by default. Click to expand the full list. Ctrl+O toggles all groups and result bodies. The summary shows present-tense labels while running (e.g. "Running commands") and past-tense when done (e.g. "Ran commands"). File edits and writes are included in the fold.
- Show a loading spinner in the conversation while `/reload` is in progress
- A risky call is returned to the model to self-correct rather than interrupting the human, escalating to an approval prompt only after a streak; no failure path auto-approves
- Experimental `experimental_enable_tab_status` config option: shows `>>` (running) and `?` (waiting) indicators in the terminal tab title.
- New built-in `worktree` plugin with a skill for creating, reusing, and cleaning up git worktrees under $VIBE_HOME/worktrees.

### Changed

- The invalid API key error now names where the key came from (`env var VIBE_API_KEY`, `the keyring`), so a shell-exported key shadowing the one saved at setup is visible.
- Optimized resource usage when running the full test suite.
- The `vibe` and `skill-creator` skills now reach a session as skills of the shipped `vibe` plugin, so they are offered once, as `/vibe:vibe` and `/vibe:skill-creator`.
- Bump harness to v0.4.3
- Vibe Desktop can create local projects from any existing folder.
- Background LLM session titles are now off by default. Set `session_logging.generate_titles = true` to re-enable them.
- Vibe CLI shows the output of a `!` command directly in the timeline: it is neither folded behind its own toggle nor gathered into the summary line that folds the agent's tool calls. Shell calls the model makes still fold, as every other tool result does.
- The `/plugins` detail view now leads with Author and Version, then the description, then Location (renamed from "Installed from"), Scope, Format, and Pinned.
- The `/resume` session picker now shows an animated loading indicator while saved sessions are discovered and waits briefly before loading a highlighted session preview, keeping rapid keyboard navigation responsive.
- A session that asks for a worktree now starts in the repository and moves into the worktree once `git worktree add` lands, so the session exists from the moment the prompt is sent instead of after the checkout. Only its first turn waits.

### Fixed

- Worktree sessions retain access to attached images and files.
- Pinning or removing a shared skill now republishes this repository's claims, so another repository's cleanup no longer deletes a skill you just added.
- Removed unauthenticated debugpy listener on localhost:5678 that was activated by `DEBUG_MODE=true` under `vibe-acp`
- A rejected API key no longer offers `/retry`, which could only fail again with the same key.
- Path autocomplete now prioritizes matches beneath an explicitly typed directory prefix in large repositories
- GrowthBook rollouts set only via a feature's default value now take effect (previously ignored)
- GrowthBook boolean feature flags now take effect, not just string on/off values
- Cached experiment variants are no longer dropped to defaults on cold start or resume
- Stop the CLI from dumping a traceback on exit when the app-server connection drops during shutdown (a failed reconnect/resume no longer crashes the event listener).
- Built-in plugins are no longer listed under "Not loaded" in `/plugins` with "Plugin namespace 'vibe' is reserved". Only a built-in may claim the reserved `vibe` namespace, but the re-resolve a session's plugin bind performs was re-reading every checkout at project scope, so the shipped `vibe` plugin was dropped from every session.
- Tool call group icon now reflects the status of the last call in the group instead of the worst (any failure no longer overrides a later success)
- Individual failed tool call indicators stay grey (muted) when a later call in the same group succeeds, instead of escalating to red
- Tool group and individual tool call indicators now show a blinking square while running, then a colored dropdown triangle when settled
- App-server validation errors now name the offending field and reason instead of only "Invalid request parameters".
- The auto-generated session title now waits for the first turn to complete and ignores the assistant's process preamble, so it names the actual task (e.g. the real subject of a linked issue) rather than an opening line like "I'll explore the codebase"
- Session titles now generate and refresh while a turn is still running — including long, tool-heavy turns that emit few assistant messages — instead of only when the turn ends or is interrupted
- A `!` command that exits non-zero (or is interrupted) now shows what it printed. Only the exit status was reported before, which hid the stderr explaining it.
- User-scope plugins (`~/.vibe/plugins/`) were shown as `project` scope in `/plugins` because the bind-time resolve collapsed all staged checkouts to project scope. Scope is now preserved from the original discovery.
- Smart approve now runs its classifier on the fast Mistral model regardless of the session's active model, including when you switch into the mode mid-turn; a session on another model (e.g. a non-Mistral provider) sent the classify call to the wrong endpoint, so every gated tool call came back unverifiable and prompted instead of auto-approving
- The smart-approve pre-check no longer fast-approves content-dumping git commands (`git diff`/`show`/`blame`, `git log -p`, `git status -v`); they defer to the classifier so a secret shown in a diff is not auto-read
- The smart-approve pre-check no longer fast-approves a secret path hidden behind a `cd` prefix (e.g. `cd ~/.ssh && ls`); the secret scan now reads the whole command, not the part after the `cd`
- The classifier now runs the fast model with deterministic decoding (temperature 0, thinking off) regardless of the session, so a thinking session no longer sends a thinking request to the small model and escalates every gated call
- A subagent's classification event under smart approve is now forwarded to telemetry like a top-level one, instead of being applied as a subagent state update — which had dropped the subagent's events from the main-agent stream
- Smart approve no longer classifies `ui.ask_user_question`; asking the user a clarifying question is the escalation channel itself, so it always runs instead of paying a classifier round-trip, being deny-and-continued, or escalating to an approval dialog to ask
- Starting with `--smart-approve` now keeps the mode in the Shift+Tab cycle for the whole session; it was selected at launch but dropped out of the cycle after switching to another mode, so you could not switch back to it
- Switching agent mode mid-turn now re-gates MCP/connector tools too: leaving smart approve stopped asking for built-in tools but kept classifying every connector call because the mid-turn config graft dropped `provided_tool_mode`
- "Approve for session" on an MCP/connector tool under smart approve now covers the whole tool instead of the exact arguments, so calling the same tool with different arguments no longer re-prompts (built-in tools keep their per-call resolver scope)
- Resuming a session created by a newer version of Vibe now shows a clear message to restart with `--check-upgrade` and update, instead of an internal store-format validation error.
- Hook commands run without a shell to prevent injection via hooks.toml

## [2.25.0] - 2026-09-03

### Added

- `/skills` browser for session skills, with search and filter; shared skills sync on session start. Experimental, off by default.
- Browser SSO completes behind split-horizon reverse proxies; opt-in `browser_auth_allow_origin_rewrite` rewrites sign-in/poll URLs onto configured origins
- Discovery of Mistral's built-in web-search connector
- Plugin-declared MCP servers in `/mcp`, tagged with their plugin and authenticatable via `/mcp login`; a pending login is announced at session start
- Connectors (Notion, Linear, Slack, GitHub, Gmail, Google Calendar, Drive) in ACP
- ACP elicitation-form clients can answer `ask_user_question` and `exit_plan_mode`
- Session-scoped model pinning for resumed conversations
- `vibe update` to check for and install a newer release

### Changed

- Connector discovery skips unsupported protocols
- `agents/list` no longer requires a session id
- Prompt queueing runs through the app server with select, edit, remove, pause, and resume controls
- `/skills` browser groups by scope, fits rows to width, and pages long lists
- `vibe --yolo` selects the `auto-approve` profile (cyclable with Shift+Tab; blockable via `disabled_agents`)
- A plugin MCP server whose name collides with an `[[mcp_servers]]` entry is dropped with a warning instead of inheriting the configured credential
- `/config` saves to user config by default; Tab cycles user / session / (trusted) project target
- Vibe CLI sends queued prompts as a single turn; Desktop keeps turn-by-turn
- `/mcp` title marks an in-flight background refresh

### Fixed

- Pruning cached skills preserves versions pinned by other repos
- Approved file operations act on the cleared path, preventing symlink redirection outside the project; approved writes outside the project execute
- Onboarding crash on a malformed `browser_auth_api_base_url` port
- Split-horizon account and re-signin reach the connector origin and adopt tenant domains from `/whoami`
- Multi-line tool descriptions (remote MCP, connector, plugin) no longer break `/mcp` layout; rows render the first line only, `[source]` prefix stripped
- Mode indicator reflects the effective tool-approval bypass (`--yolo`, `--auto-approve`, `bypass_tool_permissions`)
- Builtin `vibe` skill no longer recommends the removed `/terminal-setup` and now documents `/copy`, `/paste-image`, `/remote-project`
- Context gauge drops the discarded conversation immediately after `/clear` and `/compact`
- `/config` shows and edits the active model's effective auto-compaction threshold, preserving org-enforced global locks
- Session event stream no longer crashes on a JSON-Patch `move` from a field relocation
- `/mcp login` no longer probes with a bare GET (405 before credentials); for a plugin server it sends the plugin's declared headers and uses its own URL, not a same-named `[[mcp_servers]]` entry from another session
- Toggling an MCP row the app server refuses to change shows a notice instead of ending the session
- `/mcp add` under a plugin-owned name takes the name immediately for the configured entry
- `/mcp` refresh reconnects plugin servers, not just configured ones
- Same-named plugin MCP servers each get their own `/mcp` row with their own status and tools
- Adding then removing an `[[mcp_servers]]` entry under a plugin-owned name no longer strands the plugin's server
- A second session no longer drops the first's plugin servers or `[[mcp_servers]]` entries; each session's configured servers are its own
- A server whose name another session shares no longer gets that session's credential deleted on identity mismatch
- Context-window indicator updates on model switch without a restart
- Failed queue merge no longer leaves a ghost prompt; rewind targets the merged turn's real history entry and survives removing the first queued prompt
- Connectors/MCP panel auto-sizes to content instead of a fixed 50vh
- `/mcp` no longer paints a failing-discovery source or unlinked connector as enabled before it comes up
- Crash on closing the app while a turn is streaming
- Loading spinner keeps its "Interrupting" label in the pre-surface gap
- Closing the resume picker mid-load no longer crashes with `NoMatches`
- Invalid active model falls back to the current default; the banner model refreshes after clearing a session
- Account refresh no longer overwrites third-party provider settings on a concurrent model change
- Rewind into a new session and rewind-in-place while resyncing no longer redraw stale turns
- `/mcp` opens from cache and waits 60s before refreshing; HTTP setup runs outside the UI loop
- System trust store respected during browser sign-in
- A message sent while idle or right after interrupting no longer flashes as queued and shows the loading indicator immediately
- Escape-to-interrupt updates the status immediately; Escape+Enter to restart a queued turn no longer drops the Enter; Escape just as a turn finishes no longer stalls the next message

### Removed

### Added

- Image attachments via `@`-mentions in the TUI for vision-capable models
